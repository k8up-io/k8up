= How to Upgrade K8up

== Upgrade K8up from 0.x to 1.x

The upgrade is generally done with the following steps:

. Prepare new Helm release
. Uninstall K8up `0.x`
. Install K8up `1.x`
. Verify your backups work

WARNING: Do not remove the CRDs, as you might loose the resources!

=== Prerequisites

. `kubectl` or `oc`
. `helm` version 3, version 2 for deinstallation if you're still using Tiller

NOTE: You might need to adapt the commands to your needs.
      This guide does not provide a copy-paste upgrade script, but points you in the right direction. It also assumes that you know basic usage of Helm.

=== Prepare new Helm release

The https://github.com/appuio/charts/tree/master/k8up[Helm Chart v1.0] comes with a few new and changed properties.
Please consult the README.

Most notably, the Chart is targeted to recent Kubernetes versions.

WARNING: Use `helm upgrade --reuse-values` only when you know what you're doing.
         Some parameters have changed and are backwards incompatible.
         Make sure you have the new CRDs installed beforehand.

=== Uninstall 0.x

[source,bash]
----
# Set the namespace
ns=k8up-system
# Shut down and uninstall K8up. This should not delete the CRDs
helm -n ${ns} uninstall k8up
----

=== Install 1.x

. Make sure to migrate any changed Helm values before installing the release.
. Update the CRDs as documented in the Chart README.
. Install the Helm Chart version 1.x.

NOTE: For Kubernetes < 1.15 (OpenShift 3.11), please add `--set k8up.enableLeaderElection=false` to the `helm install` command.

=== Verify your backups work

[source,bash]
----
# See if the K8up pod came up
kubectl -n ${ns} get pods

# Check for errors in the logs
kubectl -n ${ns} logs -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=k8up"

# Trigger a new backup by creating a new Backup object
kubectl create -f <your-backup-file-spec>
----

== Upgrade K8up from 1.0 to 1.1

K8up v1.0 introduced  xref:references/schdule-specification.adoc[new special randomized Schedules] and their counterpart, the `EffectiveSchedule` CRD in which randomized schedules are persisted.

v1.1 extends this functionality with Deduplication using `EffectiveSchedules`.
However, `Schedules` using randomized cron schedules may not benefit from this deduplication prior to v1.1.

To activate deduplication for those `Schedules`, delete all affected `EffectiveSchedules` in the cluster and restart K8up.
This will generate new `EffectiveSchedules` objects, but with deduplication if the jobs match the deduplication criteria.
