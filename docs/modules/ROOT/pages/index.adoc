== Introduction

K8up (pronounced `/keɪtæpp/` or simply "ketchup") is a Kubernetes Operator distributed via a https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/tree/master/charts/k8up[Helm chart], compatible with https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] and plain https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]. It allows cluster operators to:

* Backup all PVCs marked as `ReadWriteMany`, `ReadWriteOnce` or with a specific label.
* Perform individual, on-demand backups.
* Schedule backups to be executed on a regular basis.
* Schedule archivals (for example to AWS Glacier), usually executed in longer intervals.
* Perform "Application Aware" backups, containing the output of any tool capable of writing to `stdout`.
* Check the backup repository for its integrity.
* Prune old backups from a repository.
* Restore backups with the help of the k8up CLI tool.

K8up is:

* Stable and production ready since 2019.
* Based on top of https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Restic], it can store backups in any S3-compatible storage, such as Amazon S3 or https://github.com/minio/minio#readme[Minio].
* Written in https://golang.org/[Go].
* A https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/[CNCF Sandbox] Open Source project, https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up[hosted at GitHub].
