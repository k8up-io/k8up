== Introduction

K8up (pronounced `/keɪtæpp/` or simply "ketchup") is a Kubernetes Operator distributed via a https://github.com/appuio/charts/tree/master/k8up[Helm chart], compatible with https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] and plain https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]. It allows cluster operators to:

* Backup all PVCs marked as `ReadWriteMany` or with a specific label.
* Perform individual, on-demand backups.
* Schedule backups to be executed on a regular basis.
* Schedule archivals (for example to AWS Glacier), usually executed in longer intervals.
* Perform "Application Aware" backups, containing the output of any tool capable of writing to `stdout`.
* Check the backup repository for its integrity.
* Prune old backups from a repository.
* Based on top of https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Restic], it can store backups in any S3-compatible storage, such as Amazon S3 or https://github.com/minio/minio#readme[Minio].

K8up is written in https://golang.org/[Go] and is an Open Source project https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up[hosted at GitHub].
