= Runbook: K8upJobStuck

A K8up job (backup, check, prune) has been queued without starting for a long time

== Why is this relevant?

If a `backup` cannot be started, no backup will take place.

== Troubleshooting

In the namespace that is mentioned in the `message` annotation (NOT the one mentioned in the `namespace` label):

* Check for `jobs` that could not be started/run
* Check `backup`, `check` or `prune` objects (`kubectl get backup,check,prune`)

The alert will persist, even if subsequent jobs succeed.
If subsequent jobs of the same type were successful, delete the problematic object and kill the k8up operator process (or delete the k8up pod) to resolve the monitoring alert.
